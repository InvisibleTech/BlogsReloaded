# Blogs Reloaded
## What Happened?
For a while there I was pretty stoked about `Elixir` and `Scala` and would spend time trying out tutorials and blogging about them or come to some interesting conclusion and .... blog about that.

However, during some personal life stuff, jumping into a job where I worked to acquire some *Full Stack* skills and preparing for the *JLPT N5* and then the, as-yet-untaken, *JLPT N4* I let the blogging slide for a while.

## What Now? ##
As *Covid19* changed testing center availability for me, even now, it seems I have time until June 2022 to get ready for *JLPT N4*. As such I will be getting back to sharing some experiments and lessons here.
